    <h1>Cots</h1>

        <h3>Movable  side:</h3>  side  of  a  cotthat  has  one  or  more adjustment  positions.  Its  main function  isto  provide  easy  access  to  the  occupant  of  the  cot.  The  most  common movable  sides  are  sliding  sides  anddrop-gate  sides,  butthere  maybe  more configurations (foldablesides,rotating sides, etc.).
          <h3>Stationary side:</h3> side or end panel of a cot that is not intended to slide, foldor move with respect to the frame when the product is in the manufacturer’s recommended use position. It is not allowed the movement of the side or end panel of the cot in any direction or orientation.
          <h3>Sliding side:</h3> side of a cot in which, all or part of it, can slide up and down in order to close off or  provide easy access. The most usual configuration of this type of sides consists of using a guide rod to allow free movement of the side from top to bottom and vice versa.
          <h3>Drop-gate side:</h3> side of a cotin which the lower part of the side is stationary or fixed, and above this, is located a foldable portion that is intended to pivot with respect to the frameby means of using hinges or similar mechanisms.
          <h3>Irregularly shaped cot:</h3> cots are usually designed and manufactured with rectangular shape. Any  cotwith  a  different  shape  will  be  considered  anirregularly shaped cot (e.g.oval, hexagonal, circular cots, etc.).
          <h3>Adjustment positionof a movable side of a cot:</h3> position of a movable side in which it remains  secured  or  locked,  not  being  able  to move  from  that  position  until  the locking  system  or  locking  device is  activated  to  release  it.  The  most  common adjustment positions are the ‘open’and ‘closed’positions, which correspond to the side of the cotin its lowest and highest setting positionrespectively.
          <h3>Cot base / bed base:</h3> part or component of the cot structure that is intended for a mattress to rest upon.
      <h3>Adjustment  position  of  the  cot  base:</h3> position  of  a cot  basein  which  it  remains secured  or  locked,  not  being  able  to  move  from  that  position  until  the  locking mechanismis activated to release it. The most common adjustment positions are the ‘lowest’and ‘highest’positions.-Mattress base: cot base and mattresscombined in one component.<h3>Manufacturer’s  recommended  use  position:</h3> any  position  that  is  presented  by  the manufacturer in any descriptive or instructional literature as a normal, allowable, or acceptable  configuration  for  use  of  the  product;  this specifically excludes  positions that  the  manufacturer  shows  in  a  like  manner  in  its  literature  to  be  unacceptable, unsafe, or not recommended.<h3>Access:</h3> opening created by operatinga part or parts of the cot, usually the locking mechanisms  of  the movable  sides  or  ends  of  the  cot,  so  that  it  can  be  reached without  difficulty  the  interior  of  the  cot,  thus  obtaining  an  easy  access  to  the occupant.<h3>Interior of the cot:</h3> internal space bound by the sides and ends of the cot forming the walls, and the top surface of the cot baseforming the floor.Also called ‘retention area for the occupant of the cot’.<h3>Exterior of the cot:</h3> space located outside the ‘retention area for the occupant of the cot’.<h3>Accessible area / accessible parts:</h3> when a child’s hand can not reach through sides or ends, accessible parts are the inside of the cot and the exterior of the cot within a distance  of 300  mm measured  in  any  direction.  When  a  child’s  hand  can  reach through sides or ends, accessible parts arethe whole cot except the underside of the cot base.Figure2. Representation of the accessible area or accessible parts
      <h3>Accessible structural members: </h3>components that form part of the cotand conferit structural  integrity,  such  as  slats,  spindles,  bars,  corner  posts/legs,  free  spaces formed betweenadjacent structural elements, etc.<h3>Assembly holes:</h3> any hole, gap, groove or interior opening that is accessible to the occupant  of  the  cot,  which  is  different  from  the  rest  of  holes,  gaps  or  openings defined  in  this  manual,  arising  as  a result  of  cot  assembly.  The  most  common assemblyholes are the holes created for the placement of the cotbase in each of its adjustment positions.<h3>Key structural  elements:</h3> side  assemblies,  end  assemblies,  mattress  supports(cot base), or stabilizing bars which create the occupant retention area.<h3>Locking system:</h3> mechanism consisting of a locking device and one or more operating devices, which can deactivate the locking device, e.g. by pushing a button, pressing a lever or turning a knob.-Locking  device: device  intended  to  maintain  the  cot  or  parts  of  it  in  its  intended position.<h3>Shear and squeeze points:</h3> gaps which can cause harm to parts of the body and which occur when two accessible parts move relative toeach other.<h3>Foothold / toehold:</h3> a foothold is any element or component on which the child can stand, such asledges, reliefs, protrusions, bars, etc. As footholds could be considered the following:<ul><li>a. The upper surface of the cot baseand the top surface of the mattress baseare the main footholds located inside the cot.</li><li>b. Any surface greater than 5 mm deep and 15 mm wide inclined at less than 75 degrees to the horizontal should be regarded as a foothold.</li>c. Ledges  on  the  inside  of  the  cot  that  protrude  more  than  5  mm  from  the vertical plane.</li>d. Reliefs in the internal surface of the cot deeper than 5 mm.<li>e.If ledges and reliefs are combined, the total depth shall not exceed 5 mm.</li><li>f. Any bar, protrusion, rail, tube, edge, etc., if it has a depth of 10 mm or more.</li><li>g. The upper surface of the sides and ends of the cot shall not be considered a foothold.</li></ul> <h3>Snag  points:</h3> are  generally  protruding  parts,  because  of  which  the  clothing  of  the occupant  of  the  cotcould  become entangled  or  hooked  up,  and  thus  could  cause injury to the occupantof the cot.</h3><h3>Mesh  (textile  or  plastic):</h3>  fabric  of  small  rings  linked  togetherforminga  network structure.  This  type  of  mesh  is  usually  used  for  the  construction  of  the  sides  or headboards of some types of cot

<h3>Junction line:</h3> intersection of the seat and the back rest. See Figure 5 <br>

<h3>Latch release surface (Tray):</h3> any surface on the tray latch release mechanism that results in the tray releasing from its adjustment position when a force is applied perpendicular to that surface. <br>

<h3>Locking mechanism:</h3> assembly consisting of one or more locking device(s) and one or more operating device(s). <br>

<h3>Locking device:</h3> component that maintains part(s) of the product in the position of use <br>

<h3>Operating device:</h3> part of the locking mechanism(s) designed to be activated by the carer by one or several action(s). <br>

<h3>Protective component:</h3> any component used for protection from sharp edges, points, or entrapment of fingers or toes. <br>

<h3>Protrusion:</h3> a rigid projection that is elevated above the immediately adjacent surface. <br>

<h3>Protrusion evaluation zone:</h3> areas on the exterior planes of the high chair base at the rear corners which are within 51 mm. from the corners formed by the intersection of the rear and sides planes of the base and are located between 305 mm and 432 mm. above the floor.
